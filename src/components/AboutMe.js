              &emsp;Damian has delved deep into the proverbial rabbit hole of
              bitcoin and shows no signs of turning back. He has developed
              discipline by doing what no one else will, such as packing moose
              through the Alaskan bush.
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp; From an urge to contribute to bitcoin, Damian has been
              learning what it means to be a "bitcoin developer". He went
              through a bootcamp to learn the fundamentals of writing code and
              building full stack web apps with a personal focus on the backend
              of the stack.
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp;Since then, he has continued to build his skills as a
              bitcoin developer by winning hackathons, always writing code, and
              consuming every technical resource he can find such as Jimmy
              Song's book,{' '}

                Programming Bitcoin
              </span>
              . His goals and skills are highly motivated by his desire to be
              great at what he does and build a better future.
